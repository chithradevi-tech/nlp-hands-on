**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human (natural) languages. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, generate, and respond to human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.

**Key Aspects of NLP:**
- Understanding Language
- Parsing grammar and syntax (e.g., identifying nouns, verbs, sentence structure).
- Interpreting meaning from text (semantics).
- Generating Language
- Creating text that mimics human writing or speech.
- Used in applications like chatbots, language translation, and content generation.
- Analyzing Sentiment and Intent
- Determining the emotional tone or purpose behind text (e.g., whether a review is positive or negative).
- Speech Recognition and Synthesis
- Converting spoken language into text and vice versa.
- Machine Translation
- Automatically translating text or speech from one language to another (e.g., Google Translate).
- Information Extraction
- Identifying key elements in text, such as names, dates, and locations.

**Real-World Applications:**
- Virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa)
- Chatbots for customer service
- Spam filters in email
- Voice-to-text systems
- Search engines
- Automated summarization and content moderation

âœ… **NLP Techniques**
- Tokenization
  Splits text into words, phrases, or symbols (tokens).
  Example: "Hello world!" â†’ ["Hello", "world", "!"]
- Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
  Identifies parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
  Helps understand sentence structure and meaning.
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  Detects and classifies entities in text (e.g., people, organizations, locations).
  Example: "Barack Obama was born in Hawaii." â†’ [Person: Barack Obama, Location: Hawaii]
- Sentiment Analysis
  Detects emotions or opinions in text (positive, negative, neutral).
  Widely used in social media monitoring and customer feedback.
- Stemming and Lemmatization
  Reduces words to their root form.
  Example: "running", "ran", "runs" â†’ "run"
- Text Classification
  Assigns predefined categories to text.
  Used in spam detection, topic labeling, etc.
- Machine Translation
  Automatically translates text between languages.
  Powered by models like Google Translate or DeepL.
- Text Summarization
  Extractive: selects key sentences from text.
  Abstractive: generates a concise version using deep learning.
- Coreference Resolution
  Identifies when different expressions refer to the same entity.
  Example: "John said he would come." â†’ 'he' = John
- Language Modeling
  Predicts the next word in a sequence.
  Essential for tools like predictive typing and AI text generation (e.g., GPT).

âœ… **NLP Applications**
- Virtual Assistants
  Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use NLP to understand and respond to voice commands.
- Chatbots & Customer Service
  Automate FAQs, order tracking, and support using natural conversation.
- Machine Translation
  Tools like Google Translate break language barriers using NLP.
- Email Filtering
  Spam detection and categorization in Gmail and Outlook.
- Sentiment Analysis in Marketing
  Analyze social media and reviews to gauge public opinion on products or brands.
- Voice Recognition
  Converts speech to text in apps like voice typing, YouTube captions, etc.
- Search Engines
  Google uses NLP to interpret and rank search queries contextually.
- Autocorrect and Text Prediction
  Keyboard apps (like Gboard or SwiftKey) use NLP for spelling and grammar correction.
- Content Moderation
  Automatically detects hate speech, threats, or inappropriate content.
- Legal and Medical Document Analysis
  Extracts information from complex, domain-specific documents.

ðŸ“š **PHASE 1: Text Preprocessing & Linguistics Basics**
- Text preprocessing is about preparing raw text data for analysis and modeling:

| **Concept**                   | **Description**                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lowercasing                   | Convert all text to lowercase                                     |
| Special Characters            | Remove punctuation & special characters using regular expressions |
| Tokenization                  | Split text into smaller units, like words or sentences            |
| Stemming / Lemmatization      | Reduce words to their root or base form                           |
| Stop Words                    | Remove common, non-essential words (e.g., "the", "and", "is")     |
